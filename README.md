# 🏃‍♂️ Zakiyys' Running Page

Hey there!  
This is my **personal running page**, where I keep track of my running journey – from the very first run up until today.

## 📈 What's inside?
- 📊 **Running stats** – distance, pace, calories, weekly/monthly progress  
- 🌍 **Running map** – places I've been running around  
- 🏅 **Milestones** – my personal achievements along the way  
- 💡 **Random notes** – little thoughts or stories about my runs  
</p>


## 🤔 Why I made this
I just wanted a cool place to visualize my runs, not only in Strava or an app.  
This page helps me stay consistent, see my growth, and maybe inspire someone else to start running too.
